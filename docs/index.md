# The Feminist Principles of the Internet - Version 2.0 (Annotated)

The following is a working document where we are trying to actively and continuously address how samiz-dat enacts and embodies (or in some cases maybe fails to embody) the [Feminist Principles of the Internet](https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/feminist-principles-internet-version-20). This is intended as a way for us, as an open and loose collective that is developing software, to not just signal our agreeance with these principles, but rather to actively monitor how our actions conform to and support them.

We did not author these values. They are themselves an evolving document, that originated from a global meeting on Gender, Sexuality, and the Internet in Malaysia in April 2014 organised by the Association for Progressive Communications, APC. The meeting had "50 participants from six continents comprising gender & women’s rights activists, LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans* and intersex) movements, internet and technology rights organizations, and human rights advocates. 

In their own words: 

> The goal of the meeting was to bridge the gap between feminist movements and internet rights movements and look at intersections and strategic opportunities to work together as allies and partners.
The Global Meeting used a collaborative process to ask the question: “As feminists, what kind of internet do we want and what will it take for us to achieve it?” Participants discussed and debated intersections of gender, sexuality, and the internet – not only as a tool – but as a new public space and, in thinking through these issues, developed a set of 15 feminist principles of the internet. These are designed to be an evolving document that informs our work on gender and technology, as well as influences our policy-making discussions when it comes to internet governance.

As an informal collective we support the values expressed in these seventeen principles, and want to contibute to building a feminist internet.

## preamble

> A feminist internet works towards empowering more women and queer persons – in all our diversities – to fully enjoy our rights, engage in pleasure and play, and dismantle patriarchy. This integrates our different realities, contexts and specificities – including age, disabilities, sexualities, gender identities and expressions, socioeconomic locations, political and religious beliefs, ethnic origins, and racial markers. The following key principles are critical towards realising a feminist internet.

## Access

### 1. Access to the internet

> A feminist internet starts with enabling more women and queer persons to enjoy universal, acceptable, affordable, unconditional, open, meaningful and equal access to the internet.

How does our software afford this?

### 2. Access to information

> We support and protect unrestricted access to information relevant to women and queer persons, particularly information on sexual and reproductive health and rights, pleasure, safe abortion, access to justice, and LGBTIQ issues. This includes diversity in languages, abilities, interests and contexts.

Samiz-Dat is as primarily concerned with developing software that enables unrestricted and safe publishing environment.
The software is currently only available in english.

### 3. Usage of technology

> Women and queer persons have the right to code, design, adapt and critically and sustainably use ICTs and reclaim technology as a platform for creativity and expression, as well as to challenge the cultures of sexism and discrimination in all spaces.

At the moment active code contributions have all come from cis white men.
The majority of users to date have been women. We have not been compiling statistic so have no way of monitoring active

How can we enact policies in order to increase involvement diverse genders and backgrounds?

## Movements and public participation

### 4. Resistance

> The internet is a space where social norms are negotiated, performed and imposed, often in an extension of other spaces shaped by patriarchy and heteronormativity. Our struggle for a feminist internet is one that forms part of a continuum of our resistance in other spaces, public, private and in-between.

The libraries and reading lists that Samiz Dat and Hyper Readings promote should all actively contest social norms.


### 5. Movement building

> The internet is a transformative political space. It facilitates new forms of citizenship that enable individuals to claim, construct and express selves, genders and sexualities. This includes connecting across territories, demanding accountability and transparency, and creating opportunities for sustained feminist movement building.

This is informally afforded by Samiz-Dat and Hyper-readings. There are no inforced identities, or profiles. Users are in complete control of how they choose to construct there communities.
We can control the content that is promoted publicly as part of Samiz-Dat.

### 6. Decision making in internet governance

> We believe in challenging the patriarchal spaces and processes that control internet governance, as well as putting more feminists and queers at the decision-making tables. We want to democratise policy making affecting the internet as well as diffuse ownership of and power in global and local networks.

## Economy

### 7. Alternative economies

> We are committed to interrogating the capitalist logic that drives technology towards further privatisation, profit and corporate control. We work to create alternative forms of economic power that are grounded in principles of cooperation, solidarity, commons, environmental sustainability, and openness.

### 8. Free and open source

> We are committed to creating and experimenting with technology, including digital safety and security, and using free/libre and open source software (FLOSS), tools, and platforms. Promoting, disseminating, and sharing knowledge about the use of FLOSS is central to our praxis.

## Expression

### 9. Amplifying feminist discourse

> We claim the power of the internet to amplify women’s narratives and lived realities. There is a need to resist the state, the religious right and other extremist forces who monopolise discourses of morality, while silencing feminist voices and persecuting women’s human rights defenders.

### 10. Freedom of expression

> We defend the right to sexual expression as a freedom of expression issue of no less importance than political or religious expression. We strongly object to the efforts of state and non-state actors to control, surveil, regulate and restrict feminist and queer expression on the internet through technology, legislation or violence. We recognise this as part of the larger political project of moral policing, censorship, and hierarchisation of citizenship and rights.

### 11. Pornography and “harmful content”

> We recognise that the issue of pornography online has to do with agency, consent, power and labour. We reject simple causal linkages made between consumption of pornographic content and violence against women. We also reject the use of the umbrella term “harmful content” to label expression on female and transgender sexuality. We support reclaiming and creating alternative erotic content that resists the mainstream patriarchal gaze and locates women and queer persons’ desires at the centre.

## Agency

### 12. Consent

> We call on the need to build an ethics and politics of consent into the culture, design, policies and terms of service of internet platforms. Women’s agency lies in their ability to make informed decisions on what aspects of their public or private lives to share online.

This also speaks to the need for us to better communicate how the underlying protocols work. Letting people know about how the dat protocol works, and asking for concent before joining peer networks.

### 13. Privacy and data

> We support the right to privacy and to full control over personal data and information online at all levels. We reject practices by states and private companies to use data for profit and to manipulate behaviour online. Surveillance is the historical tool of patriarchy, used to control and restrict women’s bodies, speech and activism. We pay equal attention to surveillance practices by individuals, the private sector, the state and non-state actors.

Dat allows surveillance - what are we doing to combat this or ensure that users are aware of this.

### 14. Memory

> We have the right to exercise and retain control over our personal history and memory on the internet. This includes being able to access all our personal data and information online, and to be able to exercise control over this data, including knowing who has access to it and under what conditions, and the ability to delete it forever.

There is an issue here with how Dat works - we need to write something about the limitations of removing files onces they have been shared.

### 15. Anonymity

> We defend the right to be anonymous and reject all claims to restrict anonymity online. Anonymity enables our freedom of expression online, particularly when it comes to breaking taboos of sexuality and heteronormativity, experimenting with gender identity, and enabling safety for women and queer persons affected by discrimination.

*We need to write something about privacy verses anonymity and the current limitations of Dat in terms of privacy.*

### 16. Children and youth

> We call for the inclusion of the voices and experiences of young people in the decisions made about safety and security online and promote their safety, privacy, and access to information. We recognise children’s right to healthy emotional and sexual development, which includes the right to privacy and access to positive information about sex, gender and sexuality at critical times in their lives.

We have not actively considered the use of Samiz-Dat or Hyper Readings by children and youth. Perhaps we could address this by actively hosting material that is not just relevant to our own personal interests.

### 17. Online violence

> We call on all internet stakeholders, including internet users, policy makers and the private sector, to address the issue of online harassment and technology-related violence. The attacks, threats, intimidation and policing experienced by women and queers are real, harmful and alarming, and are part of the broader issue of gender-based violence. It is our collective responsibility to address and end this.

At our current size and informality we have no policies in place regarding community conduct. This is a question of
